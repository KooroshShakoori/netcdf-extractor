# netcdf-extractor
As my first project as a python developer i worked on a tool for extracting the netcdf files more conveniently.
The main objective of the script is to read netcdf files, extract them and organize them returning a final dataframe.
This module can make working with netcdf files noticably easier, and denies the need of expensive programs such as ARCgis.
